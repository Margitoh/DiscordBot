# DiscordBot_D4countdown

This repository contains a Discord bot that counts down the time until a specific date and time, providing a countdown in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The bot is written in Node.js using the Discord.js library.

Local Setup
To run the bot locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.

In the .env file, add the following line and replace YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN with your Discord bot token obtained from discord.com/developers:
token=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN

Adjust the code in index.js to customize the countdown date and time according to your requirements.

Open a terminal in the project directory and install the dependencies by running:
npm install

Start the bot by running:
node .\index.js

The bot should now be active and ready to countdown until the specified date and time in the console.

Hosting on Railway.app
This bot can be easily hosted on Railway.app, a platform for hosting and deploying web applications.

To host the bot on Railway.app, follow these steps:

Sign up for a Railway.app account if you haven't already.

Create a new project in Railway.app and connect it to your GitHub repository.

In the Railway.app dashboard, navigate to the project settings and locate the "Variables" section.

Add a variable named token and enter your Discord bot token as the value.

Deploy the project on Railway.app. The bot will be automatically deployed and started on the platform.

The bot should now be hosted and running on Railway.app, counting down until the specified date and time. Any updates to the code pushed to the GitHub repository will trigger automatic redeployment on Railway.app.
